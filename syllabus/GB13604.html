<H3>概要</H3>This course provides an overall introduction to elementary concepts of mathematics, focusing on the fields of Maths that are often used in computer sciences. Topics include: formal logic notation, induction, sets and relations, graphs, permutations and combinations, counting principles, discrete probability.<H3>学習・教育目標</H3>The goal of this course is to provide the students a wide groundwork of mathematical concepts that are useful to understand various theories in computer science. In particular, this course focus on teaching students how to prove different theorems in different mathematical fields, and how these mathematical fields relate to computer sciences.<H3>キーワード</H3>英語講義、数論、グラフ論、統計、証明方法<H3>Keywords</H3>Number Theory, Graph Theory, Statistics, Proof Methods, Combinatorics<H3>時間割</H3><table><tr><th>Week</th><th>Subjects</th></tr><tr><td nowrap>Week 1</td><td>What is a proof?
